long_description    \
    The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers \
    more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its \
    concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most \
    out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system \
    enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly \
    to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the \
    power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled \
    language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. Go \
    is developed by Google Inc.
